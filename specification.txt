Brief Description of Javascript and Bootstrap:
I used Bootstrap for my quote on my homepage, and I used Javascript to make my webpage more dynamic.
Specifically, js helped me to go between pages and to allow my buttons to pop when hovered over.
One of my favorite features was how I got the left image to zoom in when a mouse hovers over it.

Side note:
I also learned CSS flexbox, and it was quite helpful in formatting my homepage (my old folder shows it w/out, and it made it way less responsive)
